============

It is an app for small size farmers. Based on the place chosen we will map the rainfall which will be one of the parameters for filtering the suitable crops along with the type of soil chosen.  In the next step if two crops are chosen for inter cropping, the app will give the optimum proportion in which the two crops should be grown so as to maximize the profit. This is done by using the investment and area of the field given as inputs.We calculate the different feasible solutions and zero in on the particular solution which gives the maximum profit. The concept of linear programming is made use of here.
